== Schedule

This is _loose_ schedule for the two days. We will adjust as necessary based on our pace through the material.

The lectures for this class are intentionally very light and are only intended to set the stage for the hands-on labs.
The overwhelming majority of our time will be spent engaging with the technology directly!

NOTE: We will be updating the course materials throughout the class. You will need to have the materials cloned and track the `scs_1.1` branch.

This can be accomplished as follows:

----
$ git clone https://github.com/dflick-pivotal/CloudNativeArchitectureClass
$ git fetch --all
$ git checkout scs_1.1
----
